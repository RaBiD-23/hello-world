# hello-world
=================
Today I commited a README on GitHub. My parents would have had NO idea what I just said and likely call the police.

A proper README should always contain at least one capitalized README word. Because.

Also, the intructions told me to add some lines.
And... done.

Or, at least, I thought I was... Good form demands README be completely capitalized at least 3 times inside your first README. Additional README mention inside the README both show enthusiasm and assist search rankings.

And I need to COMMIT. *Capitalization used for dramatic flair and not a requirement.

If you've already read it does a README become a README?
